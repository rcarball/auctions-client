/**
 * IAuctionsServiceProxy interface defines a contract for communication 
 * with the AuctionsService, enabling different implementations to provide 
 * the same set of functionalities for client interactions. This interface 
 * is aligned with the Service Proxy design pattern, which aims to create 
 * an intermediary between the client and the underlying service. It includes 
 * methods for user authentication (login/logout), retrieving categories 
 * and articles, and placing bids on articles.
 * 
 * By defining a common interface, we promote loose coupling between 
 * the client code and the underlying service implementations. This allows 
 * for greater flexibility and easier maintenance, as clients can work 
 * with any implementation of the interface without needing to know the 
 * specifics of how the HTTP communication is handled. For instance, 
 * both `HttpServiceProxy` and `RestTemplateServiceProxy` can implement 
 * this interface, allowing developers to switch between different 
 * implementations based on performance requirements, error handling strategies, 
 * or other factors without modifying the client code.
 * 
 * Additionally, using an interface facilitates unit testing and mocking, 
 * as it allows for the creation of test doubles that adhere to the same 
 * contract. This leads to more robust and maintainable code, as the 
 * interface serves as a clear specification of the expected behavior 
 * for any service proxy implementation.
